### Hello, I'm Ateeq Mujawar 👋

I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and making an impact through creative solutions. 
Here's a glimpse into my journey:  


## 🛠️ Projects

### **BOOSHOP MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**

**OVERVIEW:** 
1.Inventory Management Book Database The system maintains a comprehensive database of books, including details such as title, author, ISBN, price, genre, and stock levels. This database can be efficiently managed using data structures like Hash Tables or Trie for quick lookups and updates.
2.Stock Management The system utilizes data structures like Heaps to track stock levels and identify low-stock items, allowing the bookshop to replenish inventory effectively and avoid stockouts.
3.Searching and Filtering Efficient search functionalities are implemented using Trie for auto-completion and Hash Tables for quick book lookups, enabling customers to easily find their desired books based on various attributes.
4.Stock Replenishment The system optimizes stock replenishment by analyzing sales trends and predicting demand using algorithms like Dynamic Programming, ensuring that the right books are ordered at the right time.
**Technical Stack:**  
Languages: C++, Java
Algorithms: Dijkstra’s, A*, KMP, Chain Hashing, Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)
Tools: Graphs, DAA Optimization Techniques

**Impact:**

1.Improved Efficiency and Productivity Automates tasks such as inventory management, sales tracking, and order processing, reducing the time required for manual processes. Staff can focus on customer service and other high-priority tasks.
2.Enhanced Inventory Management Tracks stock levels in real time, reducing instances of overstocking or understocking. Identifies popular books and seasonal trends, allowing better decision-making regarding restocking and promotions.
3.Better Customer Experience Provides faster billing and checkout processes. Supports online sales, allowing customers to shop conveniently from home. Enables personalized recommendations based on past purchases, improving customer satisfaction.
4.Financial Management Keeps accurate records of sales, expenses, and profits, simplifying financial reporting. Reduces errors in billing and invoicing.
Data Analysis and Insights Offers detailed reports and analytics on sales performance, customer preferences, and inventory trends. Helps management make data-driven decisions.
